-- Compare Query Performance: Raw Iceberg vs Optimized Silver/Gold Tables
-- This script demonstrates the performance difference between querying raw Iceberg tables
-- (via REST catalog) and ClickHouse-optimized MergeTree tables (silver/gold layers)
--
-- Usage: docker exec -i clickhouse-server clickhouse-client < scripts/compare-query-performance.sql
-- Or: docker exec -it clickhouse-client clickhouse-client
