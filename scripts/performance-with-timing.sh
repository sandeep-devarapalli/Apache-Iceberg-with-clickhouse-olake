echo "=== SUMMARY ==="
echo "The 'time' command shows:"
echo "  - real: Wall clock time (what you experience)"
echo "  - user: CPU time spent in user mode"
echo "  - sys: CPU time spent in system mode"
echo ""
echo "Expected differences with 10,000+ orders:"
echo "  - Raw Iceberg: 2-5 seconds (network I/O, Parquet parsing, unoptimized layout)"
echo "  - Silver Iceberg: 500ms-2 seconds (ClickHouse-optimized Iceberg in MinIO, better partitioning)"
echo "  - Gold: 10-50 milliseconds (pre-aggregated metrics in ClickHouse local storage)"
